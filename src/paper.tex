\begin{abstract}
Competitive programming is a computer science competition where the contestants compete to solve computer science problems by writing a program which satisfies the problem constraints.
Autograder is used to grade contestant solutions automatically in real-time. Usually autograder is deployed in many computers to increase grading performance. In this work, contestant computers are used as worker to run autograder. By using contestant computers as worker, the number of worker will proportional to the number of contestant submissions, thus increasing grading performance. Every contestant computers have different specification and can affect grading fairness. To keep grading fairness, contestant's solution and jury's solution executed in contestant worker and compared to check whether contestant's solution satisfies problem constraints. This work tested by simulating grading process in contestant computers. The testing result indicates that using contestant computers as worker gives performance improvement in the grading process.

\section{Introduction}

Competitive programming is one of the most popular competition in computer science field. In competitive programming competition, contestants are asked to solve computer science problems correctly and as fast as possible. Some institute and organization often organize competitive programming competition periodically. Some big companies like Google and Facebook organize competitive programming competition annually. Competitive programming competition supported by online judge system. Usually, online judge system is a web based application where contestants can read the problems, create clarifications, submit their solution, and watch the scoreboard. Currently, the most popular online judge are Codeforces, URI Online Judge \cite{uriojpaper}, Uva, and SPOJ.

In order to grade contestant submissions, online judge system has a subsystem called autograder. Contestant submissions which are source code in certain programming language will be graded by autograding system by compiling the program and executes compiled program using test-cases that have been prepared by juries or problem setter. According \cite{jordanioi}, this grading method is called black-box grading. By using autograding system, the grading process can be done automatically and juries don't have to evaluate contestant submissions manually. In order to increase the number of contestant submissions in certain amount of time, juries usually deploy autograder in many computers. In order to run autograder in many computers, the juries need to prepare many computers with the same spesification to keep the fairness of grading process.

Currently, almost every competitive programing competition use online judge system to support the competition and use many computers to run autograder in order to improve grading performance. Every computers that run autograder are called worker. Grading performance is defined as the number of submissions graded in certain amount of time. Even though autograder deployed in many computers, the grading performance often not enough to evaluate contestant solutions in real-time because the number of contestants is increasing. Furthermore, the number of computer to deploy autograder affect the procurement cost that juries need to be incurred. Therefore, new grading system is needed to increase grading performance without increasing procurement cost that need to be incurred.

When competing in competitive programming competition, the contestants usually use their personal computer to write the solutions. Every contestant computers usually have sufficient specification to compile and execute contestant submissions. Therefore, contestant computers have ability to run autograder program and evaluate contestant submissions.

\section{Related Work}

There are some popular online judge system that have been used to organize competitive programming competition. Some online judge offer another additional features like discussion forum, training gate and rating system. Nowadays, most of online judge deployed as web application and use specific computer to grade contestant submissions. There are many types of competitive programming competition rules. Most of online judge only support a specific competition rules.

One of the most popular competitive programming competition is ACM-ICPC competition where the competition uses ICPC rules. In ACM-ICPC competition, contestants compete in group of three people. Every group have the same amount of problem to solve, and the score is determined by the number of solved problem and time penalty. There are many online judges that support this competitive programming rules. The most popular online judge that support this type of competition is DOMJudge. DOMJudge is very popular because it has many usefull feature, easy to use and open source.

Currently, most of online judge use autograder to evaluate contestant submissions. According to \cite{danutamalms}, autograder is a system that compiles, executes and evaluate source code. Evaluates source code manually takes three minutes while using autograder only need ten seconds. By using autograder, contestants can receive grading feedback faster and reduce the work that need to be done by juries. Basically, the autograder evaluate the source code by compiles the source code, and executes the compiled program using predefined test-cases. The output of contestant's solution program compared to the predefined test-case and then graded. This evaluation method is called black-box grading \cite{jordanioi}.

We need to consider security aspect when developing autograding system. Competitive programming contestants might submit source code that contain dangerous code. According to \cite{wasikojsurvey}, there are several attacks that can be made by contestants, such as submitting compile bomb code, submitting code that destroy autograding environment, and submitting code that access forbidden computer's resource. In order to prevent such things, autograding system must execute contestant's code in isolated environment called sandbox.

There are several ways to create isolated environment such as using virtual machine and containerization. By using virtual machine, one can create isolated operating system inside host computer. Virtual machine uses hypervisor to emulate computer hardware and run its own operating system. In Linux based operating system, there is a feature called KVM that make it possible to create hypervisor as a process in Linux \cite{wfeltervmcontainer}. We can use virtual machine to isolate the execution of contestant's code. However, by using virtual machine, we need to boot a new operating system each time we evaluate contestant's subission. This booting process takes so much computer's resource and reduces grading performance.

Another way to create isolated environment is by using container. Container is different from virtual machine. Container Container gives isolation in software level wihout hypervisor \cite{merkeldocker}. By using container, we can isolate process execution without boot a new operating system. Container works by using some Linux features such as chroot, namespace and cgroup. By using chroot, we can isolate filesystem of Linux process \cite{lessardchroot}. Container uses Linux feature called cgroup to limit process resources. By using cgroup, we can limit memory usage, CPU usage and disk IO usage of running process \cite{wfeltervmcontainer}. In order to hide other process, user, and network from a running process, container uses a Linux feature called namespace. By using namespace, we can isolate a Linux process from other process, so the running process not aware of the existance of other process. Instead of virtual machine, most of autograding system use container to isolate grading process. This method is used because it is more lighter and faster than virtual machine. 

\section{Methodology}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline

\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{images/architecture-new.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
